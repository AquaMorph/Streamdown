Okay, let's explore FizzBuzz in three different programming languages (Python, JavaScript, and C++), along with a clear description of the problem and the code.
**The FizzBuzz Problem**

FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge often used in interviews to assess basic coding skills.  The rules are:

1.  **Iterate:**  Write a program that iterates through a range of numbers (typically 1 to 100, but this can be made a variable).
2.  **Fizz:** For numbers that are *divisible by 3*, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
3.  **Buzz:** For numbers that are *divisible by 5*, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
4.  **FizzBuzz:** For numbers that are *divisible by both 3 and 5* (i.e., divisible by 15), print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
5.  **Number:** For numbers that are not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number itself.

The core concepts tested are:

*   **Loops:**  Iterating through a sequence of numbers.
*   **Conditional Statements:**  Using `if`, `else if` (or equivalent), and `else` to check divisibility and produce the correct output.
*   **Modulo Operator:** Using the modulo operator (`%`) to determine the remainder of a division.  If `x % y == 0`, then `x` is divisible by `y`.
* Basic Output.

**1. Python**

```python
def fizzbuzz(n):
    """Prints FizzBuzz sequence up to n."""
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 15 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

# Run FizzBuzz up to 100
fizzbuzz(100)

# Example with a different upper limit
fizzbuzz(20)
```

**Explanation (Python):**

*   **`def fizzbuzz(n):`**:  Defines a function called `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input.  This makes the code reusable.
*   **`for i in range(1, n + 1):`**: This loop iterates from 1 up to and including `n`.  `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., n.  Crucially, the upper bound of `range` is *exclusive*, so we use `n + 1` to include `n`.
*   **`if i % 15 == 0:`**:  This is the most important check. We check for divisibility by 15 *first*.  If we checked for divisibility by 3 or 5 first, those conditions would be met before we got to the combined case, and we wouldn't get "FizzBuzz".
*   **`elif i % 3 == 0:`**: Checks for divisibility by 3.  `elif` (else if) is used because we only want one of these conditions to be true.
*   **`elif i % 5 == 0:`**: Checks for divisibility by 5.
*   **`else:`**: If none of the above conditions are met, the number is printed.
*   **`print(...)`**: Outputs the appropriate string or number.
*   **`fizzbuzz(100)`**: Calls the function to run FizzBuzz up to 100.
*   **`fizzbuzz(20)`**: Shows how to reuse the function with a different limit.

**2. JavaScript**

```javascript
function fizzBuzz(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log("Fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("Buzz");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}

// Run FizzBuzz up to 100
fizzBuzz(100);

// Run FizzBuzz up to 30.
fizzBuzz(30);

//Alternative, more concise way
function fizzBuzzConcise(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    let output = "";
    if (i % 3 === 0) output += "Fizz";
    if (i % 5 === 0) output += "Buzz";
    console.log(output || i); // clever way to handle the case when no output.
  }
}

fizzBuzzConcise(100);

```

**Explanation (JavaScript):**

*   **`function fizzBuzz(n) { ... }`**: Defines a function named `fizzBuzz` that takes an integer `n`.
*   **`for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) { ... }`**:  This loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive).  Using `let` declares a block-scoped variable `i`.
*   **`if (i % 15 === 0) { ... }`**:  Checks for divisibility by 15.  The `===` operator is a strict equality check (checks both value and type).
*   **`else if (i % 3 === 0) { ... }`**: Checks for divisibility by 3.
*   **`else if (i % 5 === 0) { ... }`**: Checks for divisibility by 5.
*   **`else { ... }`**:  Prints the number if none of the above conditions are met.
*   **`console.log(...)`**:  Prints the output to the console.
*   **`fizzBuzz(100);`**:  Calls the function.
*   The `fizzBuzzConcise` function demostrates the conditional logic in a more performant way. It builds the output string incrementally. The use of `output || i` is a concise way in Javascript to print `i` if `output` string is empty.

**3. C++**

```c++
#include <iostream>

void fizzBuzz(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 15 == 0) {
            std::cout << "FizzBuzz" << std::endl;
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            std::cout << "Fizz" << std::endl;
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            std::cout << "Buzz" << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << i << std::endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    fizzBuzz(100);
    fizzBuzz(50);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation (C++):**

*   **`#include <iostream>`**:  Includes the `iostream` library, which provides input/output functionality (like `std::cout`).
*   **`void fizzBuzz(int n) { ... }`**: Defines a function named `fizzBuzz` that takes an integer `n` and returns nothing (`void`).
*   **`for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { ... }`**:  This loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive).  `int i = 1` declares and initializes the loop counter; `i <= n` is the loop condition; `++i` increments `i` *before* the next iteration (pre-increment).  You could also use `i++` (post-increment) here, and it would have the same effect in this specific loop.
*   **`if (i % 15 == 0) { ... }`**: Checks for divisibility by 15.
*   **`else if (i % 3 == 0) { ... }`**: Checks for divisibility by 3.
*   **`else if (i % 5 == 0) { ... }`**: Checks for divisibility by 5.
*   **`else { ... }`**: Prints the number.
*   **`std::cout << ... << std::endl;`**: Prints the output to the console.  `std::cout` is the standard output stream; `<<` is the insertion operator; `std::endl` inserts a newline character (moves the cursor to the next line).
*   **`int main() { ... }`**: The `main` function is the entry point of a C++ program.
*   **`fizzBuzz(100);`**: Calls the `fizzBuzz` function.
*   **`return 0;`**:  Indicates that the program executed successfully.

**Key Differences Across Languages:**

*   **Syntax:**  The most obvious difference is syntax.  Python uses indentation to define code blocks; JavaScript uses curly braces `{}`; C++ also uses curly braces.
*   **Variable Declaration:** Python doesn't require explicit variable type declarations.  JavaScript uses `let` (or `var`, but `let` is preferred for block scoping).  C++ requires you to declare the type of a variable (e.g., `int`).
*   **Looping:** The `for` loop structure is similar in concept across all three, but the precise syntax varies.
*   **Output:** Python uses `print()`, JavaScript uses `console.log()`, and C++ uses `std::cout`.
*   **Function Definition:** The way functions are defined (and the keywords used) differs slightly.

Despite these differences, the *logic* of the FizzBuzz solution is identical in all three languages. The core algorithm remains the same, demonstrating the portability of programming concepts.
